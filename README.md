# AI-Generated-news-reader  
AI-generated news readers offer a solution to a common challenge faced by human news readers â€“ errors that can impact revenue. While human news readers receive substantial compensation, the potential for errors remains, affecting revenue. AI-generated news readers, on the other hand, mitigate this concern by minimizing the risk of errors. This not only preserves revenue but also eliminates the time factor, as AI-generated news readers deliver content without the need for additional time investment.

# Key Points   
AI-generated high-quality faces by StyleGAN   
SimSwap for creating a studio environment   
Perfect Lipsync with MakeitTalk open source   
Currently using text to speech model for generating voice for given news text, planning to use a News API for that (0% effort)
